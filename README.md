# Ant Colony
ACO coding. I started this project in 2025. I wanted to experiment with using graphics in Java as well as create a cool mini project.
I use acm.jar as the graphics library for this code.

# How it works
A blank screen will pop-up where you click to begin. You can left-click and drag to create small obstacles for the ants. A right-click will remove obstacles that you don't want anymore. In the code itself, they're factors you can change to help the ants perform better (or even worse).
